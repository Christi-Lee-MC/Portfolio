                        Hello! Thank you for clicking to learn more about me. It's very nice to meet you.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If we were meeting in physical life the first thing you may notice is my height or maybe my
                        laugh
                        or possibly my eyeglasses. As someone who is 100% human centered in their approach to living,
                        I love that when meeting in physical life we are able to create our impressions of someone as a
                        person
                        first
                        before we are innundated by their accomplishments, statements of skill, and productivity stats.

                    <p>
                        My career began with support roles in the tech world. EDI was the start, then semiconductor
                        then web. I moved into Retail Management before starting my latest role as a Stay at Home Mom
                        to 2 amazing children.

                    <p>
                        These past 13 or so years have been filled with watching my kids grow, moves all over the USA,
                        meeting
                        great people, learning about culture within different states and cities, establishing new
                        connecctions
                        in each new adventure and growing as a small business owner and Mom.

                        Re-entry! It isn't just a space related term and it is filled with the same nuances of
                        excitement,
                        wonder, hope, uncertainty and elation when it is finally accomplished.

                    <p>
                        Re-entry is where I am right now. Re-entry involves so much change, research, self-assessment
                        and
                        planning.
                        My Re-entry Trello board has been essential to managing the process, keeping focus and allowing
                        the
                        whole
                        experience shape and grow this new era of me.

                    <p>
                        As I continue in my Re-entry, I am learning to utilize Job Search norms in 2021, upskilling with
                        the University of Arizona Full Stack Developer Bootcamp, SCRUM Master Certification and
                        following Trailhead on the path to learning SalesForce.
